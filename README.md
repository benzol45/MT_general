# Subsystems 
## Crypto gateway 
Now is only local developing. Link to repository will be here. 
 
Requests, stores and renews API access tokens.  
It don't have any database, only recives from REST API data and converts them to reglamented DTO, makes digital signature and sends to GIS MT. 
If it's an order for marking codes and in response are codes pools - sends over API them to **Code store**  
If it's other documents only recives result and if has error - sends to **Admin**. If can't connect to Admin API - sends errors to e-mail. 
 
## Code store
https://github.com/benzol45/MT_code_store  

Recives from **Crypto gateway** code pools with referance to order, stores with state: "is printed", "ready for application", "applicated", "sale". Sends by request from **Order & print** and **Marking**  
 
## Admin & config  
https://github.com/benzol45/MT_admin

## Order & print  
https://github.com/benzol45/MT_order_print   
Has cataloge of products, synchronizes it with GIS MT global cataloge.
 
UI for:

## Marking  
Don't have it now. Link to repository will be here.

Gets information about unused labels from **Code store** and sends to **Code store** information about applicate.
